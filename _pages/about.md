Hello,
I am a senior student in Electronic Engineering, Electronic Information School, Wuhan University. I worked with Professor [Wen Zhang](http://zhangwenlab.cn). Currently, I am working at MSRA as an intern.

My research interests mainly focus on Machine Learning, Data Mining and Bioinformatics. More specifically, I mainly work on the prediction of interactions between biological entities. For example, drug-drug interaction. 

I ~~am currently looking~~ will look for a PhD position in ~~2021~~ 2024 Fall. If you are interested in me or if you have some projects that we can cooperate, please contact me through email.  

Why 2024 Fall? Because the **GREAT PRESIDENT TRUMP** has ruined my plan that I have been working for so long. Now, I'll go to Fudan University for a Master degree with Professor [Shanfeng Zhu](http://datamining-iip.fudan.edu.cn/) first.
