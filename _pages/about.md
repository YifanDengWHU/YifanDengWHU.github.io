Hello,

I am a first-year PhD student in Department of Computer Science, University of Wisconsin-Madison. I worked with Professor [Anthony Gitter](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~gitter/). Previously I worked as research intern in [ByteDance AI Lab](https://ailab.bytedance.com/) and [Microsoft Research AI4Science](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-ai4science/)

My research interests mainly focus on Machine Learning and its application in biological problems. Currently I'm working on protein design and molecule edit/generation.
