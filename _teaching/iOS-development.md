This course is set as public optional. Everybody from the university can choose this course. It aims to raise the students' passion for iOS development. In this course, I served as TA for teacher Xiaogang Zhao. We taught some basic iOS development knowledge such as Swift languague, the usage of storyboard, TableView and its controller and so on. Finally, every student completed a soccer player management system as the final project.
